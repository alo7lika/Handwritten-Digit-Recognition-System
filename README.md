# Handwritten Digit Recognition System

## Overview
The Handwritten Digit Recognition System is a machine learning project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This system achieves high accuracy in recognizing digits from 0 to 9, making it a valuable tool for digit recognition tasks.

## Features
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes CNNs for effective feature extraction and classification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to input handwritten digits for real-time prediction.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Trained on the widely-used MNIST dataset with 70,000 images.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
